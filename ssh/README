== Description ==
Connect to a setup node (or all nodes) by cluster id on eLab
You can either connect to a single node by specifying its type and, optionally, id.
Alternatively, you can open connections to all the nodes using a single command.
On Linux, gnome-terminal is used.
On OSX, iTerm is used if available, and Terminal if not.

IMPORTANT:
You won't be able to connect to vHeads w/o placing your public key there.
This operation is only needed once per setup, and is performed by passing -k.

NOTE:
You can set a custom prompt with date and exit code by passing -P.
This can take a few moments, and is only needed once per setup.

== Requirements ==

- Install pexpect
sudo easy_install pexpect

- Make sure you have a key ready to be used, e.g. ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# If you don't, run ssh-keygen to create one

== Usage ==

    Examples:
        # Classic first connection - will place your public key, update the prompt and open a session to each node in setup 208
        ssh2env.py 208 -Pka
        # Classic n>1 connection - will open a session to each node in setup 208
        ssh2env.py 208 -a
        # Connect to emanage 0 on setup 208
        ssh2env.py 208 -e0
        # Skipping the id part will connect to the first node (id=0) of the requested type - same as above
        ssh2env.py 208 -e
        # Clear cached json and connect to loader 5 on setup 208
        ssh2env.py 208 -c -l5
